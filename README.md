# Learning ReScript 

* Please make pull requests to add more examples to this repo if you wish. 
  Would be super cool to create an open-source heap of examples for everyone to play with. 

Acknowledgement: much of the foundation of this content is taken from codingLawyer's really in-depth tutorial 
on ReasonML for freecodecamp. I just wrote it out, and changed things to adhere with ReScript, and took some 
things further to explore. I also used the rescript docs. But I intend to add to it over time as I discover more.

Learning ReScript from scratch knowing only Javascript is kinda really an uphill battle. Most others who learn 
ReScript know TypeScript or something before they learn ReScript. This kinda thing can be really intimidating 
if you've never seen variant types before: `option<array<LoadTopContributors.LoadTopContributors_inner.t_patrons>>`

This repo is basically a crap ton of examples
of how rescript works, for dummies rather than pros. 

If you're struggling with ReScript because you don't have loads of XP in other typed languages then you're 
in the right place here. 

We won't be doing things quickly and moving on, we'll explore details and rehash examples in an inefficient way. 
Messing around with the code and running it is basically what I was doing and what I encourage you to do. 

## Tips

Split your terminal and have your dollar sign in the foler learning-rescript and the ReScript compiler running 
in the RHS window.
