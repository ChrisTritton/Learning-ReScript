# Learning ReScript 

Acknowledgement: much of the foundation of this content is taken from codingLawyer's really in-depth tutorial 
on rescript for freecodecamp. I just wrote it out and took things further to explore combines with the rescript docs.

I have found that the ReScript docs are kinda for pros. Learning ReScript from scratch knowing only Javascript 
is kinda really impossible. Most others who learn ReScript know TypeScript or something before they learn 
ReScript. This repo is basically a crap ton of example of how rescript works, for dummies rather than pros. 

If you're struggling with ReScript because you don't have loads of XP in other types languages then you're 
in the right place here. 

We won't be doing things quickly and moving on, we'll explore details and rehash examples. 
Messsing around with the code and running it is basically what I was doing and what I encourage 
you to do.
